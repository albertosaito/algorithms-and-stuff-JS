## NPM "ideal dependency tree"
An npm ideal dependency tree is a representation of the desired dependency tree for an npm package.
It specifies the versions of all the dependencies that an npm package should use, as well as the
versions of the dependencies of those dependencies, and so on. The ideal dependency tree ensures
that all the packages and their dependencies are compatible with each other, and that there are no
conflicts or duplicate dependencies.

When an npm package is installed, npm calculates an actual dependency tree based on the package's
dependencies and their dependencies. If the actual dependency tree doesn't match the ideal
dependency tree, npm may have to make compromises, such as installing multiple versions of the same
package or using older versions of packages that are no longer actively maintained.This can lead to
issues such as version conflicts, security vulnerabilities, and package bloat.

By specifying an ideal dependency tree, developers can ensure that their packages are always
installed with the correct dependencies and that the resulting packages are consistent and
maintainable.They can also use tools such as npm audit to check for security vulnerabilities and
other issues in their packages and their dependencies.

## How to use `xargs`
`xargs` is so cool to use within your `bash` scripts, when piping/composing commands and one of them
does not play nice with this model.

`xargs` is a command line utility that allows you to pass the output of one command as arguments to
another command.

The basic syntax of `xargs` is:

``` bash
command1 | xargs command2
```
Here, `command1` is the command that produces output, and `command2` is the command that will be
executed with the output of `command1` as its arguments.

For example, let's say you have a list of file names that you want to delete. You can use the `ls`
command to list the files, and then use xargs to pass the file names to the rm command to delete
them:

``` bash
ls | xargs rm
```
This command will delete all the files in the current directory.

By default, `xargs` reads input from standard input (stdin) and separates the input into arguments
based on whitespace. However, you can also specify a different delimiter using the `-d` option.

For example, if you have a list of files separated by commas, you can use the -d option to tell
`xargs` to use a comma as the delimiter:

``` bash
echo "file1,file2,file3" | xargs -d',' rm
```

This command will delete the files file1, file2, and file3.

You can also use the -I option to specify a placeholder for the argument. The placeholder will be\
replaced with the input argument in the command that `xargs` executes.

For example, let's say you have a list of directories and you want to create a file called
`README.txt` in each directory. You can use the `-I` option to specify the directory name as a
placeholder:

``` bash
ls -d */ | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "This is the README file for directory {}" > {}/README.txt'
```

This command will create a README.txt file in each directory in the current directory.

There's a lot of ways to use and abuse this tool!
