## NPM "ideal dependency tree"
An npm ideal dependency tree is a representation of the desired dependency tree for an npm package.
It specifies the versions of all the dependencies that an npm package should use, as well as the
versions of the dependencies of those dependencies, and so on. The ideal dependency tree ensures
that all the packages and their dependencies are compatible with each other, and that there are no
conflicts or duplicate dependencies.

When an npm package is installed, npm calculates an actual dependency tree based on the package's
dependencies and their dependencies. If the actual dependency tree doesn't match the ideal
dependency tree, npm may have to make compromises, such as installing multiple versions of the same
package or using older versions of packages that are no longer actively maintained.This can lead to
issues such as version conflicts, security vulnerabilities, and package bloat.

By specifying an ideal dependency tree, developers can ensure that their packages are always
installed with the correct dependencies and that the resulting packages are consistent and
maintainable.They can also use tools such as npm audit to check for security vulnerabilities and
other issues in their packages and their dependencies.

# Bash/Shell Script
## How to use `xargs`
`xargs` is so cool to use within your `bash` scripts, when piping/composing commands and one of them
does not play nice with this model.

`xargs` is a command line utility that allows you to pass the output of one command as arguments to
another command.

The basic syntax of `xargs` is:

``` bash
command1 | xargs command2
```
Here, `command1` is the command that produces output, and `command2` is the command that will be
executed with the output of `command1` as its arguments.

For example, let's say you have a list of file names that you want to delete. You can use the `ls`
command to list the files, and then use xargs to pass the file names to the rm command to delete
them:

``` bash
ls | xargs rm
```
This command will delete all the files in the current directory.

By default, `xargs` reads input from standard input (stdin) and separates the input into arguments
based on whitespace. However, you can also specify a different delimiter using the `-d` option.

For example, if you have a list of files separated by commas, you can use the -d option to tell
`xargs` to use a comma as the delimiter:

``` bash
echo "file1,file2,file3" | xargs -d',' rm
```

This command will delete the files file1, file2, and file3.

You can also use the -I option to specify a placeholder for the argument. The placeholder will be\
replaced with the input argument in the command that `xargs` executes.

For example, let's say you have a list of directories and you want to create a file called
`README.txt` in each directory. You can use the `-I` option to specify the directory name as a
placeholder:

``` bash
ls -d */ | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "This is the README file for directory {}" > {}/README.txt'
```

This command will create a README.txt file in each directory in the current directory.

There's a lot of ways to use and abuse this tool!

## How to use `sed`
`sed` is a powerful command line utility that is used for text processing and editing. It stands for
"stream editor", which means that it reads a text stream from standard input (or a file) and
performs editing operations on it. Here's a brief tutorial on how to use sed:

The basic syntax of sed is:

``` bash
sed [options] 'command' file(s)
```
Here, `options` are optional command line options that modify the behavior of sed, `command` is the
editing command that you want to perform on the input text, and `file`(s) are the input file(s) that
you want to process.

Here are some common sed commands:

### substitute (s): Replace a string in the input text with another string.

``` bash
sed 's/old/new/' input.txt
```
This command replaces the first occurrence of "old" in each line of `input.txt` with "new".

You can use different delimiters to separate the fields in the s command. For example, you can use a
colon as the delimiter instead of a slash:

``` bash
sed 's:old:new:' input.txt
```
You can also use the `g` option to replace all occurrences of the string in each line:

``` bash
sed 's/old/new/g' input.txt
```

### delete (d): Delete a line or a range of lines from the input text.

``` bashCopy code
sed '3d' input.txt
```
This command deletes the third line from input.txt.

You can also delete a range of lines by specifying a start and end line number:

``` bash
sed '2,5d' input.txt
```
This command deletes lines 2 to 5 from input.txt.

### print (p): Print lines that match a pattern.

``` bash
sed -n '/pattern/p' input.txt
```
This command prints all lines that contain the string "pattern" in input.txt.

The `-n` option tells sed to suppress the default output, and the p command tells it to print only
the lines that match the pattern.

### append (a): Append text after a line.

``` bash
sed '/pattern/a text to append' input.txt
```
This command finds the first line that contains "pattern" in `input.txt`, and appends "text to
append after it.

You can use the `i` command to insert text before a line, and the `c` command to replace a line with
text.

### read (r): Read a file and append its contents after a line.

``` bash
sed '/pattern/r file.txt' input.txt
```
This command finds the first line that contains "pattern" in `input.txt`, and appends the contents
of `file.txt` after it.

Note that the `r` command reads the contents of the file at the time of execution, so changes made
to `file.txt` after the sed command is executed will not be reflected in the output.

These are just a few examples of the many sed commands available. sed also supports regular
expressions, backreferences, and other advanced features for more complex text processing tasks.

On the same subject, **backreferences** are a powerful feature of `sed` that allow you to match and
replace patterns using the text captured by regular expressions. Here's an example of how to use
backreferences:

Let's say you have a file called `input.txt` with lines of text in the following format:

```
Firstname Lastname
```
And you want to swap the first and last names to get lines in the following format:

```
Lastname, Firstname
```
You can use `sed` with backreferences to achieve this. Here's the command:

``` bash
sed 's/\(.*\) \(.*\)/\2, \1/' input.txt
```
Let's break down the previous funky command:

- `s:` This specifies that we want to perform a substitution.
- `\(.*\):` This is a regular expression that matches any number of characters and captures it as a
group (denoted by the parentheses).
- `\(.*\):` This is another regular expression that matches any number of characters and captures it
as a group.
- `/\2, \1/:` This is the replacement string, which uses backreferences to swap the captured groups
and add a comma and space between them.
So, when sed encounters a line like `Firstname Lastname`, it captures "Firstname" and "Lastname" as
groups, and then replaces the line with "Lastname, Firstname".

Note that we use `\1` and `\2` to refer to the captured groups in the replacement string. `\1`
refers to the first captured group (i.e., the first name), and \2 refers to the second captured
group (i.e., the last name).
