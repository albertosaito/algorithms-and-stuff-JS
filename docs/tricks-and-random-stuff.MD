## NPM "ideal dependency tree"
An npm ideal dependency tree is a representation of the desired dependency tree for an npm package.
It specifies the versions of all the dependencies that an npm package should use, as well as the
versions of the dependencies of those dependencies, and so on. The ideal dependency tree ensures
that all the packages and their dependencies are compatible with each other, and that there are no
conflicts or duplicate dependencies.

When an npm package is installed, npm calculates an actual dependency tree based on the package's
dependencies and their dependencies. If the actual dependency tree doesn't match the ideal
dependency tree, npm may have to make compromises, such as installing multiple versions of the same
package or using older versions of packages that are no longer actively maintained.This can lead to
issues such as version conflicts, security vulnerabilities, and package bloat.

By specifying an ideal dependency tree, developers can ensure that their packages are always
installed with the correct dependencies and that the resulting packages are consistent and
maintainable.They can also use tools such as npm audit to check for security vulnerabilities and
other issues in their packages and their dependencies.

## Unit testing interval

This can be tricky sometimes... To unit test a JavaScript function that runs in an interval, you can
 use Jest's jest.useFakeTimers() function to mock the timer APIs and control the passage of time in
 your test.

Here's an example of how you can test a function that runs in an interval using Jest:

``` javascript
// myIntervalFunction.js
function myIntervalFunction() {
  setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Hello from the interval!');
  }, 1000);
}

module.exports = myIntervalFunction;
```

``` javascript
// myIntervalFunction.test.js
const myIntervalFunction = require('./myIntervalFunction');

jest.useFakeTimers();

test('myIntervalFunction should log every second', () => {
  myIntervalFunction();

  // Advance time by 1 second
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);

  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Hello from the interval!');

  // Advance time by 3 more seconds
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(3000);

  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(4);
});
```

In this example, we're testing a simple function that logs a message to the console every second
using `setInterval()`. We use `jest.useFakeTimers()` to mock the timer APIs so we can control the
passage of time in our test.

We call `myIntervalFunction()` to start the interval, and then we use `jest.advanceTimersByTime()`
to advance time by 1 second and check that the message was logged to the console. We then advance
time by 3 more seconds and check that a total of 4 messages were logged.

Note that in order for `jest.advanceTimersByTime()` to work properly, your interval function should
use setInterval() instead of setTimeout(). If your function uses `setTimeout()`, you can use
`jest.advanceTimersToNextTimer()` instead to advance time to the next timer.
