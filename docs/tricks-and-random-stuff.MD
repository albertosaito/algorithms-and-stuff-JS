## NPM "ideal dependency tree"
An npm ideal dependency tree is a representation of the desired dependency tree for an npm package.
It specifies the versions of all the dependencies that an npm package should use, as well as the
versions of the dependencies of those dependencies, and so on. The ideal dependency tree ensures
that all the packages and their dependencies are compatible with each other, and that there are no
conflicts or duplicate dependencies.

When an npm package is installed, npm calculates an actual dependency tree based on the package's
dependencies and their dependencies. If the actual dependency tree doesn't match the ideal
dependency tree, npm may have to make compromises, such as installing multiple versions of the same
package or using older versions of packages that are no longer actively maintained.This can lead to
issues such as version conflicts, security vulnerabilities, and package bloat.

By specifying an ideal dependency tree, developers can ensure that their packages are always
installed with the correct dependencies and that the resulting packages are consistent and
maintainable.They can also use tools such as npm audit to check for security vulnerabilities and
other issues in their packages and their dependencies.

`xargs` is so cool to use within your `bash` scripts, when piping/composing commands and one of them does not play nice with this model.
