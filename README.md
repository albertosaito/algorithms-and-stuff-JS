# Algorithms and Stuff in JS!
## Shortest Path
- Shortest Path Algorithm using adjacency matrix and BFS-Dijkstra
- Prints shortest distance and path
- O(l) Where l is the number of available locations in the adjacency matrix (nxm)

## Rotate Strings
- Rotate a string with substring function
- Check if a string is a rotated version of another. This algorithm works by
concating string A twice and checking if string B is a substring of the concatenated string.
